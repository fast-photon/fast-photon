- 👋 Hi, I’m @fast-photon
- 👀 I’m interested in OI (Olympiad in Informatics) and MC(Minecraft).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to make a successful Minecraft server at the version 1.12.2 with both mods and plugins.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... nothing.
- 📫 How to reach me? Guess!  
I want ask you if your mother tongue is English (or you are good at English) :  
First, do you know how to translate the informations on the programme I programmed, can make **nearly everyone** that good at English understand?  
Second, how to improve my English grades?  
~~Last, can you help me finish my holiday task on English?~~
